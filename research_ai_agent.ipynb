      "Summary: OpenAI, Inc. is an American artificial intelligence (AI) organization founded in December 2015 and headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop \"safe and beneficial\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom, OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI.\n",
      "The organization has a complex corporate structure. As of April 2025, it is led by the non-profit OpenAI, Inc., registered in Delaware, and has multiple for-profit subsidiaries including OpenAI Holdings, LLC and OpenAI Global, LLC. Microsoft has invested US$13 billion in OpenAI, and is entitled to 49% of OpenAI Global, LLC's profits, capped at an estimated 10x their investment. Microsoft also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.\n",
      "In 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI's products. In November 2023, OpenAI's board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company's prominent role in an industry-wide problem.\n",

      "Summary: OpenAI o3 is a reflective generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model developed by OpenAI as a successor to OpenAI o1 for ChatGPT. It is designed to devote additional deliberation time when addressing questions that require step-by-step logical reasoning. On January 31, 2025, OpenAI released a smaller model, o3-mini, followed on April 16 by o3 and o4-mini.\n",
